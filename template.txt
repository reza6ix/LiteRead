Subject: Missed calls at {business_name}?

Hi {first_name},

I'm reaching out because I suspect {business_name} might be missing {customer_type} calls after hours, which means losing lifetime value on new {customer_type}s.

I run a team that installs 24/7 AI receptionists. We don't just "book appointments"—we handle support, intake, and scheduling instantly, day or night.

**My bold promise:** If there is *any* repetitive admin task your front desk hates doing, I will build an automation to fix it within 48 hours. **If it doesn't save you at least 10 hours a week, you don't pay a dime.**

I’m currently working with a few other local businesses and have capacity for one more this week.

Open to seeing how it works?
